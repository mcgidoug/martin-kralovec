      <p>
        I am an artist and illustrator located in Chicago. I work with pen and
        ink mostly but explore all different types of media; including but not
        limited to markers, watercolor, acrylic, and paint. I am stylistically
        versatile, which allows me to reach a larger clientele. I use my art to
        work out thoughts and convey emotion. I am inspired by googie art,
        books, art nouveau, nature, gothic, horror art, and movies. From this, I
        create projects, series, minicomics, and individual pieces of work.
